# 100-days-of-Python

This application will help users to find the cheapest flight from a given location to multiple different locations from the next 6 months.
It uses inbuilt libraries from python such as requests and datetime.
APIs from Twillo (for sending SMS), KIWI (for getting flight details) and Shetty (for updating and reading from a google sheet) are used here.
